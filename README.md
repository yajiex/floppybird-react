#Floppy Bird React

This project is a fork of https://github.com/nebez/floppybird, the original project is written with primitive HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Currently I'm learning [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html), so I rewrite it using React.

The project is still under development, the initial version completes the basic floppy-bird scenarios. I'm becoming familiar with React and will make the project more "React".

Floppy Bird React
=========
This project is a fork of https://github.com/nebez/floppybird, the original project is written with primitive HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Currently I'm learning [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html), so I rewrite it using React.

The project is still under development, the initial version completes the basic floppy-bird scenarios. I'm becoming familiar with React and will make the project more "React".

Build
------------
The project is built with WebPack, thanks to https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/08/setting-up-react-for-es6-with-webpack-and-babel-2.html for the guides.

`npm install --save-dev`
`npm install webpack-dev-server -g`
